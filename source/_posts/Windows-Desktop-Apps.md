Determine the best one for your application

**UWP, WPF, and Windows Forms**. 

These platforms provide *managed runtime environments 【托管运行时环境】* (the Windows Runtime for UWP, and .NET for Windows Forms and WPF) with many benefits, especially in the areas of developer productivity, sophisticated and customizable UI, and application security. Because these frameworks support visual designers and UI markup for rapidly creating UI, they are particularly well-suited for line-of-business applications.

**Win32 API**. 

The Win32 API (also called the Windows API) provides a first-class development experience without depending on a managed runtime environment like .NET and WinRT. This makes the Win32 API the platform of choice for applications that need the highest level of performance and direct access to system hardware.
